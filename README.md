# queuing-dynamics-simulation

Simulation for a multi-server queue queuing dynamics for 5 servers where the probability of a job being completed is 0.5 time slots, uses a JSQ load balancing algorithm, and plots the mean delay as a function of the arrival time for various values of lamba arrival times.

Also plots the histogram of the delays for lambda=0.45, with the x-axis being possible delays and the y-axis being the fraction of jobs experiencing that delay.
